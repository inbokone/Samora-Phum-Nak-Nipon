All occurrences in this series are fictionally created for entertainment purposes only. Viewer discretion is advised.

2
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,840
How peculiar. I intended to kill you, yet my sword...

3
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,940
Why isn't it obeying you, right?

4
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,420
Hongmeng Sacred Sword won't harm only two people.

5
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,420
The first is me,

6
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,680
and the other is my destined partner.

7
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,840
Duan Ru Xing

8
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,370
Why can't Hongmeng Sword even scratch you?

9
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,900
Why is it you?

10
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,990
What's the meaning of this?

11
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,370
Shen An

12
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,390
Don’t you know?

13
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,240
I'm the one destined to be with you.

14
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,170
How is that possible?

15
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,460
Let me...

16
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,390
tell you why.

17
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,610
It's because…

Pharinyakorn Khansawa

Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

28
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,620
Bruh.

29
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,300
Why can't I think of anything?

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm writing a wuxia novel, but why is it turning into a romance?

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,190
While I'm writing,

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,970
Why do I keep picturing Shan as the hero?

33
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,260
It must be because of that.

34
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,370
I'm Shi Er Ye.

35
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,370
Ta-da!

36
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,500
Look, Ob-aun, you're this close to the great god Shi Er Ye.

37
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,660
Yes, Little Prince?

38
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,420
Not this part, move forward a bit.

39
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,550
You're too close.

40
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,640
I want to capture you in my gaze.

41
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,040
This is the turning point.

42
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,220
It's over, Little Prince.

43
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,700
Amazing!

44
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,330
Shan, your acting was amazing!

45
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,930
You truly are incredible at both writing and acting.

46
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,260
I felt like I was watching a stage play.

47
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,240
You really got into character.

48
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,220
Reading quickly and writing excellently,

49
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,770
I respect your skills.

50
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,820
I give up.

51
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,440
Wait.

52
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,130
You don't have to drink.

53
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,750
Let's change it to... how about a meal with me?

54
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,190
Well, let's take a picture together!

55
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,840
Come on, let's take a picture.

56
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,300
Move a bit, move, move.

57
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,060
Okay.

58
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,860
One, two, three.

59
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,640
One, two, three.

60
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,420
All done.

61
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,700
I've already posted it on Instagram.
What?

62
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,659
Who are you!? Let me go!
No.

63
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,990
How did you get into my room?

64
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,480
In a forest on Earth, a fox successfully caught a rabbit.

65
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,300
The rabbit trembled under the fox.

66
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,460
This is the cruel law of natural selection,

67
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,190
and an encounter between natural enemies.

68
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,130
Isn't this 'The dream on the pillow'...

69
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,930
that Ozone gave me?

70
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,260
Why is it different from what Shan read?

71
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,970
The character names are the same,

72
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,770
but the plot isn't.

73
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,280
At that moment, I thought those eyes were my whole world.

74
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,240
But back then, I was too young.

75
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,480
I didn’t realize what that thought meant.

76
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,660
If it were me now,

77
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,500
If it were me now,

78
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,130
who meets you back then,

79
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,620
I know I couldn’t help but say…

80
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,190
When thinking of this,

81
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,460
Suddenly, He Zhi couldn’t take it anymore.

82
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,100
He slowly moved closer to Xu Yiming,

83
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,680
And lightly kissed his face.”

84
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,700
There really aren't any lines like that,

85
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,170
but why did Shan look so real?

86
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,700
If those lines aren't from this book,

87
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,730
then where did he get it from?

88
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,480
Ugh, I can't figure it out. I'll just ask Ozone then.

89
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,790
Ozone, open the door.

90
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,150
Ozone, you there?

91
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,900
Ozone, are you okay? Open up.

92
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm fine, I'm going to bed.

93
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,880
Are you really okay?

94
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,060
Yeah.

95
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,790
What are you thinking about, Little Prince?

96
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,730
Why didn’t you follow the novel script when we’re role-playing?

97
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,260
I did follow a novel.

98
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,220
Have you read any of my works?

99
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,700
I've never read your novels.

100
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,790
What's with that smile?

101
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,330
Come on, let me see what's making you smile like that.

102
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,150
For what?

103
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,530
Lin Song Yue raised his hand, and lightly knocked on the door twice.

104
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,130
Why would you want to read it?

105
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,860
He waited for a response,

106
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,130
but was also afraid to hear one.

107
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,950
Just as he was about to turn away,

108
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,150
there were soft knocks from behind the door,

109
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,730
as if responding to him.

110
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,330
Lin Song Yue leaned against the door and smiled.

111
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,930
While he was smiling, the door was opened.

112
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,820
Wow.

113
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,460
Seriously, the work of the great Shi Er Ye isn't just for show.

114
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,370
No wonder you're smiling like that.

115
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,990
Of course! He’s my idol, remember?

116
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,950
Don't tell me you started writing online novels because of him.

117
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Nah.

118
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,280
I've wanted to be a writer since I was young.

119
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,970
But Shi Er Ye is one writer

120
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,680
whom I look up to in my writing career.

121
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,370
What about me?

122
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm also the great god of YS, you know?

123
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,590
Do you really want me to say it? It might be hurt.

124
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,330
By the way,

125
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,440
don’t you feel like Shi Er Ye’s works are a bit strange?

126
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,480
How?

127
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,420
The main characters in his works all have something in common.

128
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,730
Like what?

129
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,370
Like Lin Song Yue.

130
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,950
He has a secret signal—two knocks, and three knocks in response.

131
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,240
Each story is different, sure,

132
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,790
but they always have similar element like that.

133
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,790
It's as if...

134
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,640
As if?

135
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,790
he's been searching for someone all along.

136
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,900
So, he wrote about that person in his story.

137
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,770
Wow, I'm pretty sharp, huh?

138
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,620
Just like Sherlock Holmes.

139
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Then you're my Dr. Watson, Ob-aun.

140
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,150
Okay.

141
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,590
But why does Shi Er Ye's work seem familiar?

142
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,100
Little Prince, what are you thinking about?

143
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,100
Nothing.

144
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,770
I'm leaving. I don't want to talk to a cheater.

145
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,840
Wait.

146
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,100
Who are you calling a cheater?

147
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,970
I don't know. I'm going to bed.

148
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,220
Good night, Little Prince.

149
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,390
My name is Ob-aun.

150
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,460
Good night, Ob-aun.

151
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,840
Good night.

152
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm taking the bus home. Are you coming with me?

153
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,220
Why are you asking? You know I'm taking the train.

154
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,170
Okay, I'll go catch my bus. Get home safely.

155
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,480
See you, Ob-aun.

156
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,240
Bye.

157
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,460
Surprise! Are you shocked?

158
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,240
I came to drive you myself.

159
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,480
Great, thanks. You're right on time.

160
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,970
What are you looking at?

161
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,680
And... don't you look a bit different?

162
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,730
If you're my driver, take my bag.

163
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,860
Hey, where are you going? My car's this way.

164
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,130
Go on ahead. I can get home on my own.

165
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,840
Huh?

166
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,130
Hey, Shan! Shan!

167
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,770
What's wrong with him?

168
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,060
Ob-aun. Ob-aun.

169
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,640
Can I have your number?

170
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,530
Here you are.

171
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,730
Alright, I'm going now.

172
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,080
Wait.

173
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,840
I already have your Instagram.

174
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,170
Can I also have your Line, Facebook, and X?

175
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,440
Are you my debt collector or something?

176
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,730
Is that a problem?

177
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,300
Here you go.

178
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,930
Can I go now?

179
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,990
Why are you following me?

180
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,130
I'm not following you.

181

Oh, you’re taking the same bus.

182
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,130
Isn’t it enough?
Not yet.

183
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,500
Can we go another round?

184
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,240
I can’t wait anymore.

185
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,770
Is it hard to take off?

186
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,130
Why?
I think someone’s knocking on the door.

187
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,750
You’re just hearing things.

188
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,300
I mean it.

189
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,680
Hey!

190
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,240
Quick, get up.

191
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,370
Why are we getting up?
Just hurry up.

192
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,020
Rome, open the door.

193
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,730
Go to my room first.

194
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,420
Rome, open the door.

195
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,330
You didn’t tell me you were coming back.

196
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,750
I texted you already.

197
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,480
Hi.

198
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,750
Hi.

199
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,990
Didn’t you say your roommate wouldn’t be back for a while?

200
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,350
I just walked past him.

201
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,990
What am I gonna do?

202
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,370
We can just stay like this.

203
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,350
I have no choices left, Rome.

204
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,040
If I’m kicked out, I’ll have to sleep on the street.

205
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Calm down, darling.

206
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,680
No one’s kicking you out.

207
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,530
You’re too stressed.

208
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,730
Cheers.

209
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,420
This one is good.

210
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,280
That’s enough. You’ve had enough.

211
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,100
I’m drunk.

212
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,950
What? Is it because of the “I’m sorry”?

213
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,570
“I’m sorry”? What’s that?

214
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:39,460
I’m sorry for being bad at apologizing and making up.

215
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,790
I teased you out of love.

216
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:49,970
But I love only you because you're my soulmate.

217
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,620
I’m sorry for being bad at apologizing and making up.

218
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,190
Oh baby, don't be sulky.

Huh?
We need to talk.

223
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,730
I also have something to say.

Aren’t you being too loud?

225
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,460
Didn’t we agree that you wouldn’t bring your boyfriend here again?

226
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,330
I was being as quiet as I could.

227
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,880
You called that quiet?

228
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,190
I can’t sleep.

229
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,370
Well, if you can’t bare it, why don’t you move out?

230
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,330
Fine.

Hello?

244
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,990
I was trying to say, I’m actually looking for a roommate.

245

Can I think about it first?

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,530
Where are you now?

247
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,900
I’m at my condominium.

248
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,990
Can I ask where your place is?

249
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,900
It’s near Rama 1.

250
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,700
I’m near Rama 1 right now. Let me go pick you up.

251

No, please don’t. I don’t want to trouble you.

Whoa, what a coincidence.

253
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:45,950
I didn’t know Rama 4 and Rama 1 were so close.

Don’t be nosy.

So who is it that a young master like you is even willing to share a room with?

It’s Little Prince.

Hello, brother…

258
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,730
My name is Akin, but you can call me Kin.

259
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,130
Okay, P’Kin. My name is Ob-aun.

260

Oh, so Ob-aun is the Little Prince.

261
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,990
If you stay here, you can rest assured.

262
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,390
If you need anything, just let me know and I’ll bring it to you.

263
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,660
Oh, about the rent—

264
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,570
I’ll charge you half of what Shan pays.

265
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,590
How much is half?

266
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,750
10,000 baht.

267
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,020
10,000?

268
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,350
I understand. This room is so luxurious.

269
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,990
10,000 is actually quite cheap.

270
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,020
But I have to pass.

271
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,300
My budget is only 8,000.

272

That's fine.

273
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,550
I just need someone to split the rent with me, so 8,000 is good.

274

He can afford such an expensive place, but still need someone to share the rent?

275
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,130
But it's okay, I guess.

276

You can take a look around first.

If you move in, you won’t have to worry about feeling uncomfortable.

What are we gonna do?

284
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,770
I’m not sure, but you should come get your things and go sleep somewhere else for now.

285
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,300
Okay, I’ll hurry back.

286
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,570
Alright.

288
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,700
My roommate said the water pipe just burst.

289
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,750
So the room is flooded.

290

293
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,860
Thank you so much, Shan.

294
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,280
And thank you so much, P’Akin.

295
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,639
It’s nothing.

296
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,330
You’re hungry, aren’t you?

297
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,420
Let’s go get something to eat.

298
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,969
Your stomach is protesting so much.

299
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,370
Hurry up.

300
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,820
Hurry up.

301
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,620
An army marches on its stomach.

302
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:03,900
I love this place. The seafood here is the best in my heart.

303
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,440
Oh.

304
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,880
I just remembered. Don’t you have something to do?

305
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:14,460
You can go ahead. Call a taxi and leave the car with me.

306
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,880
Call a taxi?
Yeah.

307
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,620
Hurry up. Don’t worry about us.

308
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,170
And don’t forget to take care of the room.

309
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,680
I mean…

310
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,930
remember to pay the electricity bill.

311
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,020
Go.

312
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Oh, got it.

313
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,260
I’ll take care of some business first, Ob-aun.

314
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,530
What a shame, I thought we’d eat together.

315
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,840
Actually, he’s allergic to seafood, so he can’t eat it.

316
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,280
Let’s get inside.

317
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,990
Do you like fish too?

318
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,170
Thanks.

319
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,950
You don’t have to serve me.

320
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,330
If someone debones it for you, the fish will taste better.

321
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,900
You’re so kind. Do you enjoy deboning fish for others?

322
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,570
Not for others.

323
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,530
A friend of mine once told me.

324
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,970
It took me a long time to understand this feeling.

325
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,280
Then, let me serve my favorite dish for you.

326
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,550
Do you like shrimp?

327
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,880
It’s your favorite. You should eat it.

328
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,330
I like shrimp a lot, but I also like fish as much.

329
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,190
Let’s go inside. I’ll show you your room.

330
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,130
Okay.

331
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,590
Make yourself at home. Feel free to use this room as you like.

332
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,260
Okay.

333
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,950
Hey.

334
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,420
You.

335
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,770
Are you alright?

336
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,660
Wait a moment. I have a candle.

337
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,040
Hey.

338
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,880
Hey.

339
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,460
Sorry.

340
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,840
It’s just…

341
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,570
You’re afraid of the dark, right?

342
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,260
I’m sorry.

343
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,500
I didn’t mean to.

344
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,860
Can you not go anywhere?

345
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,570
May I ask...

346
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,790
why you're afraid of the dark?

347
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,100
Something bad happened.

348
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,150
But I’m better now. Only these little symptoms are left.

349
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,390
Ozone: SOS!

350
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,300
I can’t write. My brain's about to explode.

351
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,680
Who in the world could write?

352
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,950
Who in the world could write?

353
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,370
Who in the world could write?

354
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,950
I can write.

355
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,660
Lord Shi Er Ye, please leave the group.

356
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,350
Please get out.

357
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,390
Everyone, help!

358
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,440
I've got no inspiration. What should I do?

359
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,480
I just bragged to my fans yesterday that I'd update daily for 3 months.

360
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,260
And this is just the first day!

361
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,060
If I can't think of anything, I’d go for a walk and get some ideas.

362
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,770
Let me scroll through Instagram for inspiration.

363
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:35,100
The best solution is doing something to distract yourself.

364
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,930
Like exercising.

365
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,570
I've never had writer's block.

366
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,060
How about reading other books for inspiration?

367
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,190
Reading books?

368
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,530
But I only have Sci-Fi books.

369
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,080
So, to find inspiration...

370
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,970
Hey, I've got an idea!

371
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,950
What is it?

372
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,790
Boss, why don't we write a BL novel together?

373
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,660
If all 5 of us work together,

374
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,300
we won't have to worry about daily updates.

375
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,240
It’ll be a good change of pace and inspire us.

376
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,970
Bruh, aren’t you just doing this for yourself?

377
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,350
What's the trending BL novel right now?

378
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,130
Wait, are you actually buying his idea?

379
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:19,150
Think of it as honing your skills and building your portfolio.

380
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,950
I have no problem actually.

381
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,480
Bro, Shi Er Ye will never agree to this.

382
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,170
I’m cool with that.

383
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,460
You need to agree now.

384
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,930
I'm not available.

385
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,640
You're not available because you're going out with that bad boy, right?

386
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,040
What about you? Why didn't you let me into your room at the hotel?

387
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,530
Tell us the truth. What exactly happened?

388
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,110
[Puppy]

389
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,300
Hello?

390
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Hello?

391
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,060
You've drunk quite a lot.

392
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,260
Did you just realize?

393
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,530
Do you still remember who I am?

394
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,480
You're... who?

395
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,370
Aren’t you quite handsome?

396
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,840
Just kidding, of course I know.

397
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,970
You're the demon lord of YS, the manuscript chaser.

398
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,170
You still dared to make a joke?

399
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,020
Wait a second, did you just say you're not going to update your novel?

400
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,680
Ugh, my head hurts. I'm going to sleep.

401
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,930
Where's the keycard?

402
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,080
In my bag.

403
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,590
Ozone, open the door.

404
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,150
Ozone, are you okay? Open up.

405
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,300
I'm fine, I'm going to bed.

406
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,860
Are you really okay?

407
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,300
Yeah.

408
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,770
Pretending to be drunk, huh?

409
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,570
If I'm drunk, I don't have to update the novel, right?

410
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:12,840
Dream on.

411
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,100
Hey.

412
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,020
We forgot we had phones.

413
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,860
We can use the flashlight on it.

414
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,930
The power's back on.

415
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,420
Let me show you to your room, you haven't seen it, have you?

416
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,880
This way, please.

417
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,790
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

418
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:36,680
Our group of five, The 5yes of Wonder, has officially debuted in BL novel!

419
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,680
Readers are hyping about it. How should we write the first meeting scene?

420
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,950
The first meeting doesn't have to be love at first sight.

421
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,190
No, I like love at first sight.

422
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,570
I like love at first sight too.
