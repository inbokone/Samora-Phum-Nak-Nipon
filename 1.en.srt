Yes, maam.
Come back quickly, we have lots of customers.

Yes, what do you need? Water? One second.

Hey.

29
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,250
How many places you have to go?

30
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,230
Four places, bro.

31
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,400
I don't get you.

32
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,800
As a novel writer, you barely have any free time left,

33
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,890
yet you still work here as a delivery man.

34
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,030
The economy is in a slump, bro, so I’ll do whatever I can.

35
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,510
Alright, fine.

36
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,490
So where are you delivering to?

37
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,230
River Village and around that area.

38
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,960
There's also sister Ping too.

39
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,980
And Condo 85.

40
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,400
Huh? Did you just say Condo 85?

41
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,940
Yeah, why?

42
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,470
Don't you know that Condo 85 has weird stuff going on?

43
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,410
What kind of weird stuff?

44
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,670
My senior used to deliver there,

45
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,150
he said it's suuuper creepy.

46
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,170
You're talking nonsense.

47
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,170
That condo is high-end, you know.

48
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,110
What are you guys talking about?

49
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,050
About Condo 85.

50
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,820
Have you ever delivered there?

51
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,290
Condo 85?

52
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,270
I haven’t.

53
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,290
But a senior I know did.

54
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,930
He said,

55
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,330
Even though the condo is fancy, there's one floor that's super scary.

56
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,730
There's one room covered with talismans.

57
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,290
Like they’re trying to ward off something.

58
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,370
Yeah, I’ve heard about that too.

59
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,290
They say there's a hallway,

60
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,190
filled with incense sticks, red threads, and offerings along the way.

61
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,960
And have you heard about this?

62
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,690
They say there’s a murderer who likes d*smember*ng bodies there.

63
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,090
Oh, I've heard about it.

64
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,710
They say anyone who goes there gets k*lled.

65
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,780
And some voices asking you...

66
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,690
'How do you want to d*e?'

67
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,580
'Wanna d*e a tormented de*d?'

68
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,000
It has both ghosts and a murderer.

69
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,270
Are the ghosts the people who were k*lled by that murderer?

70
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,270
Are you all going mad from watching too many movies?

71
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,650
Hey! Whoa!

72
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,630
What are you talking about? Why haven't you gone yet?

73
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,340
Yes, maam.

74
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,200
Customers are waiting.

75
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,740
Come over and line up here. Three bags for this bill.

76
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,830
Two bags for this one.

77
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,690
Got it.

78
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,510
Hah! they better work as diligently as they slack off.

79
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,430
What the f*ck were they talking about?

80
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,090
Hey, don't dawdle and hurry back.

81
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,290
Today is busy.

82
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,600
Hello.

83
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,310
Hey, Ob-aun.
Hello.

84
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,360
Hmm.

85
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,760
Thanks a lot, good bye.
Thank you.

86
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Safe travel.

87
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,250
Anyone, please help my cat.

88
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,960
It got stuck in the tree, please help.

89
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,800
Anyone, please help.

90
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,510
Help me please.

91
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,780
My cat is stuck in the tree, please help me.

92
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,580
Okay.

93
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,270
Alright, then let me help your orange cat down.

94
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Thank you.

95
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,090
Thank you so much.

96
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,310
Oh, how are you, Tabby, hm?

97
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,090
Hmm, are you tired?

98
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,670
Hey.

99
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,270
You.

100
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,050
Please wait!

101
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,510
Sir.

102
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,140
Hold on!

103
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,360
Thanks a lot for helping me out earlier.

104
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,510
You walk really fast, huh?

105
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,510
I haven't had a chance to thank you yet.

106
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,980
No problem.

107
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,470
I really need to thank you.

108
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,560
My name's…
Shan!

109
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,630
Something wrong?

110
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,540
Nothing.

111
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,230
Let’s go.

112
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:05,467
Hey, what were you talking about with that person?

113
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:08,467
He came to thank me for helping him.

114
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,157
Hurry up and walk, I want to take a shower.

115
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:15,047
I came all the way to drop you off, and now you are chasing me away?

116
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,377
I've finished sending you home, so I'm heading back now.

117
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:22,707
Gotta find some relaxation. These past two days have been exhausting.

118
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:24,267
Fine.

119
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:47,067
Oh no, the GPS took me to the river.

120
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,377
Or do they live in the water?

121
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:56,027
Crazy me, how could Condo 85 be underwater? I better hurry.

122
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:23,027
Hello, sir. Your food delivery has arrived.

123
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:24,977
Oh, it's here already?

124
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,137
Take it up to the room right away.

125
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:28,487
Sure thing, sir.

126
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,827
And place it in the room...

127
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,847
Hello, hello?

128
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:42,757
My phone's dead.

129
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:05,377
My senior used to deliver there, he said it's suuuper creepy.

130
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:13,447
Even though the condo is fancy, there's one floor that's super scary.

131
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:17,027
There's one room covered with talismans.

132
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,937
Yeah, I’ve heard about that too.

133
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:24,157
They say there's a hallway,

134
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:29,557
filled with incense sticks, red threads, and offerings along the way.

135
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:40,907
They say there’s a murderer who likes d*smember*ng bodies there.

136
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,887
Anyone who goes there gets k*lled.

137
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,357
And some voices asking you...

138
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,287
'How do you want to d*e? Wanna d*e a tormented de*d?'

139
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,907
Stop, don’t move.

140
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:40,847
You better stay still if you cherish your life.

141
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:59,707
Don’t even try to escape, you’re going to die here anyway.

142
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:04,467
Let’s start with a knife.

143
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:14,707
Ah.

144
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,577
I’ll slowly cut the vein on your wrist.

145
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:38,487
Cut the vein and make you bleed slowly.

146
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,797
Hey, what are you doing!?

147
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,797
Who are you!? Let me go!

148
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:58,307
No.

149
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:00,307
How did you get into my room?

150
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,707
What are you going to do to me? Let me go!

151
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,137
No.
Let go!

152
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,667
I can’t let you go.
I told you to let me go.

153
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:08,597
Don’t do this.

154
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,577
How did you get into my room?

155
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,087
What you’re doing isn’t right.

156
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:24,797
Release me.
I won’t

157
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:29,197
We have laws. If you kill someone, you’ll definitely go to prison.

158
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:32,537
You should run away!

159
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:37,937
Can you let me go now?

160
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,957
Isn’t this the man who helped me when I fell from the tree?

161
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:47,357
If I let you go, don’t do anything to me, okay?

162
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:49,157
Okay.

163
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,287
Hey, what are you doing with me? You crazy bastard!

164
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:00,777
You psycho!

165
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:02,557
I’m sorry.

166
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:04,937
I didn’t mean to.

167
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:06,577
You.

168
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:10,467
Can you not go anywhere?

169
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:17,337
Eh, it tickles!

170
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,507
Hey.

171
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,997
So you are afraid of the dark?

172
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:35,137
Okay, you let me go first.

173
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:38,027
I’ll be by your side until the lights come on.

174
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:41,737
Alright?

175
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:36,307
Hey Shan.

176
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:52,867
I asked you to deliver the food. Why did you end up in the bathroom?

177
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,507
I heard things like someone’s planning murder, so I went in to help.

178
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,937
Plan what? You’re absurd!

179
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,287
I'll complain about you.

180
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,287
But it’s not my fault.

181
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,447
I wanted to leave long ago, but your friend held me tightly.

182
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:09,467
Enough.

183
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:13,157
No way! Can a delivery kid raid someone else's house?

184
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,777
I have to call and inform the shop owner.

185
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,847
Wait a sec.

186
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,777
Wasn't it you who told me I could come in?

187
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,487
Alright.

188
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,557
In that case, I'll go first. Sorry again.

189
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:41,467
Shan.

190
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:43,267
What?

191
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:47,247
Normally, you wouldn't just let it slide.

192
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,397
Why did you let him go so easily this time?

193
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:54,047
I found him.
Huh?

194
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,737
Found who? Don't tell me…

195
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:58,667
Yes.

196
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,247
How could you be so sure it's him?

197
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:04,267
By the smell. I remember his scent.

198
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:13,487
You have his number, right?

199
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,467
Ob-aun.

200
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:37,757
Sis.

201
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:42,177
A customer called and complained that you delivered late.

202
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,337
I wasn't late. It's just...

203
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:50,047
Actually, there was an accident.

204
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:52,427
How many times have you been like this?

205
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:55,647
You might not be cut out for this job.

206
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:57,647
Sis.
Come on.

207
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:00,537
Find something more suited to you.

208
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:02,267
No, sis. I apologize.

209
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,627
Give me back the shop phone and car key.

210
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:09,107
Please, I'm really sorry.

211
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:11,487
Ob-aun, am I a joke to you?

212
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,227
Give them back.

213
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,227
What a shame. Look what I got from lending a hand.

214
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:48,357
You guys too, I don't want another incident like this.

215
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,247
Ob-aun, you’re in trouble.

216
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,667
Did you copy the work of the godly writer Shi Er Ye?

217
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:16,997
Readers are furious.

218
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:36,997
(Shui)

219
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,647
Hey, Little Prince.

220
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,847
You're in big trouble for copying work this time.

221
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,227
But I didn't copy.

222
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:50,937
Then you need to find evidence. Or else…

223
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,397
Or what?

224
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:56,537
You'll get sued and banned.

225
00:22:59,197 --> 00:23:01,937
How can I find evidence if I didn't copy?

226
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:06,467
Alright, I'll see what I can do. That's it for now.

227
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:38,267
Have you been kicked out of the shop, Little Prince?

228
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,827
Who are you?

229
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:50,047
I'm just calling to advise you that if you can't write, then don't write.

230
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:51,707
Get out of the industry.

231
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:57,867
And one more thing, prepare to be sued.

232
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:25,247
Hello, the shop is closed.

233
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,797
Hello.

234
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:30,937
I'd like to ask about the person who delivered food to Condo 85 today.

235
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:34,847
Um...

236
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:37,827
Is there a problem with the order?

237
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,157
Oh, no.

238
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:44,757
I just want a way to contact him. Is that possible?

239
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,337
You mean Ob-aun?

240
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:50,487
I just kicked him out a moment ago.

241
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:56,597
But I have to apologize to you. Our policy doesn't allow staff phone numbers.

242
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,597
Even though he's already left.

243
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:00,937
I'm sorry, sir.

244
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:03,307
Oh, okay.

245
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:05,507
Thank you.

246
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,397
I didn't copy anything.

247
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:29,537
Uh, I know you didn't.

248
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,267
Cut the crap. Why'd you call?

249
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:39,287
I wanna tell you that I found out where that Shi Er Ye guy lives.

250
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:42,427
Why don't you go see him? Maybe you can work something out.

251
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:45,337
Why should I? I didn't copy anything.

252
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:50,557
It’s up to you. I believe you no matter what.

253
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:54,087
But readers and people online don’t know you like I do.

254
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:56,427
Well, you will need to go see him ASAP.

255
00:25:56,427 --> 00:25:58,757
I heard he’s leaving Bangkok tomorrow.

256
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,337
Did you get this info from Khun Pai?

257
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,067
Don’t mind me. I’ll send you the location.

258
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:05,847
Alright.

259
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:12,067
Room 1510, Condo 85.

260
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:18,067
Hey, what are you doing!?
What you’re doing isn’t right.

261
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,957
What are you doing with me? You psycho!

262
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:24,177
I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to.

263
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:26,627
Can you... not go anywhere?

264
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:33,157
Damn, the world is small.

265
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:42,597
Hey, you don’t need to go find Shi Er Ye right now. Just go meet him in Chiang Mai.

266
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:45,937
YS will be holding Shi Er Ye's debut party there.

267
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,799
Next, let's give a round of applause to our divine guest,

268
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,249
The "Great God" writer, Shi Er Ye.

269
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:35,849
As you know, Shi Er Ye is number one among our YS website novel writers

270
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:38,509
and rarely attends social events.

271
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,829
It's an honor for everyone to come today.

272
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,869
Hello, I'm Shi Er Ye.

273
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,869
Today I have to thank everyone very much.

274
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:01,249
I didn't think that the real Shi Er Ye would look calm.

275
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,109
But I have to say

276
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,599
About you being accused of copying his work, I'm still so angry.

277
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,939
Everyone is condemning you.

278
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:14,979
Since he's here now, I have to talk to him.

279
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:17,779
What about?

280
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,029
Demanding justice for you.

281
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:33,289
Oh, there are a lot of people cheering.

282
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,579
Truly worthy of being a great god.

283
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:40,669
Seeing it like this, who would dare to go looking for trouble?

284
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,539
I wonder, is Shi Er Ye so famous because of a novel.

285
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:47,869
Or because of his good looks?

286
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:55,779
[Chinese] "A good person will not flatter others just because they speak well, and a good person will not abandon others' correct opinions because they have a shortcoming."

287
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:56,739
Samut,

288
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,999
please speak a language that I can understand.

289
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:06,939
[Chinese] "There is nothing better than improving yourself, if you don't want other people to look down on you."

290
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,599
Okay, I surrender. Go ahead.

291
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,089
Why did you show up this time?

292
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,939
I heard that there's a new writer in your care.

293
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,159
Congratulations.

294
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,849
I don't see anything happy about it.

295
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:43,829
It's just a baby monkey that can't sit still.

296
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,849
He's become the number two writer in YS, Chief Editor.

297
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:52,089
That doesn't sound like an ordinary baby monkey.

298
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,179
I was asking about you.

299
00:29:58,539 --> 00:29:59,829
I have nothing to answer.

300
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:14,489
Honestly, I still can't figure out why I wrote the exact same plot as Shi Er Ye.

301
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:19,489
I was confused when you came to consult me ​​and told me the plot.

302
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,909
I still think it's really fun.

303
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:27,559
But there's no way for you to know Shi Er Ye's thoughts, right?

304
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,159
Yes.

305
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,249
Unless...

306
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:30,829
Unless what?

307
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,599
You and Shi Er Ye share one mind.

308
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:34,869
Your brains are connected.

309
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,309
Are you delusional?

310
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,669
Am I? Think about it...

311
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:43,049
One person writes mystery stories. Another writes about war.

312
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:46,539
It's not only unrelated, it's a completely different style,

313
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,109
but the situation is exactly the same.

314
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,249
In Shi Er Ye's novel

315
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:55,689
There's a little fox who tells a story to a little hedgehog.

316
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,849
In yours, it's a little hedgehog who tells a story to a little fox.

317
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:02,269
If it's not fate, then what is it?

318
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:09,359
I think... your brain is stuffed full of novel plots.

319
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,399
Come out to the real world, Ozone.

320
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,869
Op-aun, are you saying I'm imagining this?

321
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:29,089
Can I have your autograph, please?

322
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:29,669
Okay.

323
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:30,829
Thank you.

324
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,289
Could we take a picture, too?

325
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:35,629
Oh, that's alright.

326
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:40,629
Thank you. I really like your work.

327
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,309
Mr. Shi Er Ye

328
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:46,709
Great God Shi Er Ye, nice to meet you.

329
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:48,709
Nice to you meet you.

330
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:52,979
Nice to meet you, Great God Shi Er Ye.

331
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:54,799
Shall we...

332
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,379
go have a drink?

333
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,979
Is there anything I can help you with, sir?

334
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,399
Can I borrow a power bank?

335
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,179
Yes, please. Just a moment.

336
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:21,359
Okay, sir.

337
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,139
Thank you.

338
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,249
You're welcome.

339
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:41,489
Aun!

340
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,489
Here you are.

341
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:44,689
What is it?

342
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:47,029
I have a way for you to clear things with Shi Er Ye.

343
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,649
What?

344
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,089
Come on.

345
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:52,799
You two, hurry up and come here,

346
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,629
Ta da!

347
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:58,889
Aun, you are so close to the great god Shi Er Ye.

348
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,629
Aren't you excited at all?

349
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,379
What's there to be excited about? Do you want me to kneel and bow?

350
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:08,179
It doesn't have to be like that.

351
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,909
And you, why did you bring me here?

352
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:13,029
Like I said, so you could clear things up, my friend.

353
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:31,649
So let me introduce myself first. I'm Ozone.

354
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:33,069
I'm Sin.

355
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:35,579
I'm the oldest here. Jao Samut.

356
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:40,959
Ob-aun.

357
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:45,979
Then let's play a game. The night is young.

358
00:33:45,979 --> 00:33:47,599
If you want to sleep, too bad.

359
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,959
I won't play.

360
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:52,199
[Chinese] "If I don't do something useful. How can I use this limited life well?"

361
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,649
I agree! But what did you say?

362
00:33:57,489 --> 00:34:00,629
Sorry for causing you trouble. There's the matter of plagiarism.

363
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:04,289
You and I need to have a long talk about that matter.

364
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:07,469
As for you, O. Are you really my friend?

365
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:11,429
Oh, forget about that. Come play a game with me.

366
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,429
Think of it as a charitable deed.

367
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,799
Whatever, I'll play along.

368
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,289
I chose this game carefully. It's the perfect game for us

369
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,289
The Four Pillars of YS.

370
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:29,739
No, wait. We are

371
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,309
"K5"

372
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,240
"Cirrus". God of Sci-Fi.

373
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,160
"Little Prince". God of Wuxia.

374
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,840
"Chin Hai". God of Drama.

375
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,600
"Sleepy Fox". God of Fantasy.

376
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,160
"Shi Er Ye". Great God.

377
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:54,849
What the hell is this?

378
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,489
An erotic novel.

379
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,489
Yaoi?

380
00:34:58,979 --> 00:35:00,739
So let me explain how to play

381
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,959
In my hand are five cards.

382
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:07,429
Three Aces, one black-and-white Joker, and one colored Joker.

383
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,429
Everyone will draw one card each.

384
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:14,359
The person with the colored Joker can order the one with the black-and-white Joker. To do anything.

385
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,179
As for what to order...

386
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,089
Are you being naughty?

387
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:20,889
What's in your head?

388
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:25,469
I'm just saying the person who gets the colored Joker card, choose one book at random.

389
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:27,979
Then select a page and paragraph.

390
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:30,689
The person who receives the black-and-white Joker must read it.

391
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:32,269
No less than three lines.

392
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:36,029
If you can't read it, drink a full glass of wine.

393
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,759
So what's the name of your game?

394
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:40,069
"War Below the Line"

395
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:41,599
Is the name exciting?

396
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:45,849
Well it's too late to withdraw. Round One, Start!

397
00:35:58,227 --> 00:35:59,047
Reveal your cards.

398
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:04,687
I got the colored Joker. Who got the black & white Joker?

399
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,937
Alright, I won’t hold back, bro.

400
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:15,357
This book, page 156, line five.

401
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:22,537
"Generous sugar daddy." the title tells you everything.

402
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:26,707
Alright, here I go.

403
00:36:26,737 --> 00:36:30,247
"Win blushed deeply.

404
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:36,827
He couldn’t help but glance at the person next to him, who was still asleep.

405
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:44,757
His right hand couldn’t resist caressing the swollen part below.

406
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:47,427
The intensity and speed seemed to—"

407
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:51,557
Okay, I'm done.

408
00:36:57,797 --> 00:36:58,957
Why’s everyone so quiet?

409
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,687
Wow, that content...

410
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,487
But you read it in such a monotone voice. So dull.

411
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:07,737
Should I read it again?

412
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:11,177
No need, I bet you'd read it the same way.

413
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:14,227
Let's move to the next round.

414
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:21,197
Three, two, one, reveal your cards.

415
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:24,027
I got the colored Joker.

416
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:26,227
Who got the black & white one?

417
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:30,157
That would be me.

418
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:36,687
Please go easy on me, Ob-aun. I’ll…

419
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:41,027
I'll give you the money I got from Ozone.

420
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:45,737
Page 78, first paragraph.

421
00:37:51,957 --> 00:37:54,977
"His eyes turned towards the door.

422
00:37:55,357 --> 00:38:00,337
He saw only a figure in a long black cloak. Those slender fingers…

423
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:04,357
Is gripping a staff tightly.

424
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:09,307
Thesis looked into the pitch-black eyes of the figure and said,

425
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:14,047
'You are the general in Klein's world, aren't you? That staff—'"

426
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:16,827
Ugh, I can't keep reading.

427
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:18,627
I'll just drink.

428
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:23,977
Wait. Isn’t your reaction a bit much?

429
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:25,667
Let me see that.

430
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:29,937
It’s not that erotic.

431
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:33,577
Just the two main leads meeting for the first time. Not a big deal.

432
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:39,427
I write novels too, you know.

433
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:41,337
It's gotten to my head.

434
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:46,647
Just reading a few sentences makes me imagine what will happen next.

435
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:48,777
The more I think, the more I blush.

436
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:52,107
Why? Have you experienced it?

437
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:56,867
Of course not! Who would do something like that?

438
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:01,447
I'm embarrassed.

439
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:23,507
Um, can I change the book?

440
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:25,737
You set the ‘cannot change’ rule yourself.

441
00:39:26,427 --> 00:39:28,647
Why? Is it an 18+ scene?

442
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,377
No, not really.

443
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:34,137
Or is it?

444
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:35,827
Yes or no?

445
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:38,537
Let me see.

446
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:42,447
Oh.

447
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:44,687
What is it?

448
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:46,177
Check this out.

449
00:39:46,757 --> 00:39:47,597
Come here.

450
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:50,507
Huh, the male lead’s name is Pie.

451
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:54,027
Same as your editor, Ozone.

452
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:56,427
Argh!

453
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,357
Go big or go home.

454
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:01,067
No, I'm not giving up. I'll read it.

455
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:05,867
"Pie… used both hands

456
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:08,757
to caressed his chest.

457
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:13,557
Slowly unbuttoning his shirt.

458
00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:18,597
Pie’s slender fingers traced the firm muscles of his chest."

459
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:20,957
“Pie…”

460
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:33,307
Idiot, Pie

461
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:38,467
Hello?

462
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:41,597
I’m not updating my novel today, I’m drunk.

463
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:47,957
You’ve got a secret, huh?

464
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:51,557
You’re always such a tease.

465
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:59,847
Three, two, one, reveal your cards.

466
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:13,177
It’s you, Shi Er Ye.

467
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:20,907
Yes, Little Prince?

468
00:41:27,957 --> 00:41:30,337
I think this time we should go bigger.

469
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,067
And how do you want me to do that?

470
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,627
Just reading isn’t fun enough.

471
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:46,307
You have to read aloud and act it out

472
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,977
For at least five lines.

473
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:52,307
If you can do it, I’ll drink all this wine myself.

474
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:57,577
But if you can’t, you have to drink it all.

475
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,197
Deal

476
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:32,227
“He fell asleep.

477
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:35,557
He Zhi let out a soft sigh.

478
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:38,157
He walked forward,

479
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,957
Saw the person on the sofa sleeping soundly

480
00:42:46,687 --> 00:42:49,177
Suddenly, He Zhi felt a bit cowardly.

481
00:42:51,577 --> 00:42:53,227
He reached out his hand,

482
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:56,627
Wanted to touch the person in front of him,

483
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,227
But he didn’t dare.

484
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:18,507
Do you remember the first time we met?

485
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:24,687
At that time

486
00:43:25,627 --> 00:43:27,777
Your eyes were just like now

487
00:43:28,557 --> 00:43:32,267
Full of sparkles and mesmerizing like thousands of stars

488
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:38,687
It was filled with spirit, curiosity and wonder.

489
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:44,197
At that moment, I thought those eyes were my whole world.

490
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:47,577
But back then, I was too young

491
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:52,067
I didn’t realize what that thought meant.

492
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:56,247
If it were me now

493
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:04,687
If it were me now

494
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:07,997
Who meets you back then

495
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:17,867
I know I couldn’t help but say…

496
00:44:21,247 --> 00:44:22,507
You’re too close

497
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,287
I want to capture you in my gaze

498
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,467
When thinking of this

499
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,447
Suddenly, He Zhi couldn’t take it anymore

500
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:45,647
He slowly moved closer to Xu Yiming,

501
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:56,737
And lightly kissed his face”

502
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:13,737
It’s over, Little Prince

503
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:18,847
Already?

504
00:45:23,907 --> 00:45:26,547
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

505
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:29,727
Why didn’t you follow the novel script when role-playing?

506
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,797
I did follow a novel, have you read my work?

507
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,107
Don’t you feel like Shi Er Ye’s work is a bit strange?

508
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:40,947
It’s like he’s been searching for someone all along.

509
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,177
Can I have your number?

510
00:45:43,837 --> 00:45:46,837
I’m looking for a roommate. Do you need a lift?

511
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:52,817
So who is it that a young master like you is even willing to share a room with?
